# --------------------- Welcome to GradCalc! ----------------------
# This program is a small project I created to determine graduation date for adults continuing their education. All others I found online were based on either age or year of high school graduation. Neither of those were any help to me. I just wanted to make something useful that would also serve as practice. Error control for all possible user entries has not yet been incorporated.
# This was written in JetBrains Pycharm IDE and is the only tested execution at this time.
